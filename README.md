# Web Project — Performance-Oriented Landing Page

A responsive single-page web project with custom interactive logic implemented without third-party JavaScript libraries.  
The main focus of the project is performance optimization, layout stability, and clean, maintainable code architecture.

---

## 🔧 Technologies

- **HTML5** (semantic and valid markup)
- **CCS3/SCSS** (Flexbox, Grid)
- **JavaScript** (ES6+)
- **UI-Kit:** no third-party libraries or frameworks
- **Gulp** (build automation & optimization)

---

## 🔧 Build & Tooling
- Gulp — build automation and asset optimization
- CSS and JavaScript minification
- Autoprefixer for cross-browser compatibility
- Image optimization
- Development server with live reload

---

## 🧩 Implemented Features

- Two custom sliders (built from scratch, without Swiper, Slick, or similar libraries)
- Modal windows
- Tabs
- Accordions
- Burger menu
- UI state management using vanilla JavaScript

---

## 🚀 Performance & Core Web Vitals

The project is optimized according to PageSpeed Insights and Core Web Vitals best practices.

**Current metrics:**

- First Contentful Paint (FCP): **2.6 s**
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): **4.5 s**
- Total Blocking Time (TBT): **0 ms**
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): **0**
- Speed Index: **~4.7 s**
- Performance Score: **78**

### ℹ️ LCP Limitation Notice

The LCP metric is affected by embedded video content loaded from external domains.  
These video resources are included in the LCP calculation and cannot be optimized at the project level (server, format, or CDN).

This is an architectural limitation rather than a performance optimization issue.

---

## ✅ Code Quality & Stability

- Successfully passes HTML validation
- No layout shift issues (CLS = 0)
- Minimal main-thread blocking (TBT = 0 ms)
- Controlled resource loading
- Stable visual layout across devices

---

## 📌 Project Highlights

- All interactive logic implemented manually
- No dependency on external JavaScript libraries
- Performance optimization without degrading user experience
- Clean, scalable, and maintainable codebase
- Engineering-focused approach rather than metric chasing
